Net-OrkutSpider version 0.02
=========================

Net::OrkutSpider uses WWW:Mechanize to scrape orkut.com.
Output is a simple xml format containing friends, communities and profiles for a given Orkut UID.
Two example scripts are provided.

WARNING

I am not sure if Orkut.com allows this kind of software. So don't blame me if anything happens.
The script is really slow if you want to grab a lot of users.
If you try to grab too much (>60 users) it may not work at all.
This is just another example for the powers of WWW::Mechanize.
